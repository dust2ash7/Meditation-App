# Sound credits — Stillpoint

Stillpoint has two kinds of file beds: **original music** by Raven Flock (the Soft chip) and **CC0 nature field recordings** (Rain, Deep rain, Beach, Nature). Hush is generated in the browser by `sounds.js`, and the begin/end chimes are Web Audio sines; neither uses a file.

## Originals — Raven Flock, made in Aerie

The three Soft beds are original compositions written for Stillpoint in [Aerie](https://github.com/dust2ash7/Aerie) and rendered by Aerie's own audio engine. No samples, loops, or free-licensed material are used. The Aerie project files are in [`source/`](./source/).

| File | Title (ID3) | Practice | Loop | Key / mode | Project |
|------|-------------|----------|------|------------|---------|
| `stillpoint-sit.mp3` | Stillpoint Sit | Timed sit (4 in / 6 out) | 60 s (6 breath cycles) | D major pentatonic | `source/stillpoint-sit.aerie.json` |
| `stillpoint-box.mp3` | Stillpoint Box | Box breathing (4-4-4-4) | 64 s (4 squares) | A minor (Aeolian) | `source/stillpoint-box.aerie.json` |
| `stillpoint-wind.mp3` | Stillpoint Wind-down | Wind-down (4-7-8) | 76 s (4 cycles) | E♭ major, low register | `source/stillpoint-wind.aerie.json` |

- **Artist:** Raven Flock. Composition in Aerie: Raven Flock Sound Design. Calm target cards, loudness spec and measurements: Raven Flock Brain Researcher.
- **Render:** Aerie offline `renderWav` (44.1 kHz, 16-bit, stereo), exported at 3× the loop length; the middle repetition is cut sample-exact so reverb tails wrap into the loop start. Sit and Wind-down use a 500 ms crossfade built only from Aerie output to smooth the seam.
- **Loudness:** two-pass `loudnorm` (linear gain only), −16 LUFS integrated, true peak ≤ −3.5 dBTP, LRA 1.2–2.6 LU. Seam head/tail within ±1.5 dB of the loop body.
- **Encode:** MP3 128 kbps CBR, 44.1 kHz, joint stereo. Tags: `artist=Raven Flock`, `title=Stillpoint <Bed>`, `comment=Original composition (Aerie). Consider the ravens.`
- Pulse-free on a 60 BPM grid; loop lengths are whole multiples of each practice's breath cycle. These are design choices, not health claims.

## Nature field recordings — CC0 1.0 (not Raven Flock compositions)

All four are **CC0 1.0 Universal** (public domain dedication). Attribution is not required; it is given here for honesty. ID3 tags on each file name the real recordist and source.

## Formerly used (CC0, retired)

The Soft beds used these CC0 tracks from OpenGameArt until the Aerie originals replaced them:

| File | Track | Author | Source |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `stillpoint-sit.mp3` | First Light Particles | Yoiyami | https://opengameart.org/content/first-light-particles-%E2%80%93-cc0-atmospheric-pianoambient-track |
| `stillpoint-box.mp3` | The Budding of Consciousness (Yoiyami Blue Series No. 4) | Yoiyami | https://opengameart.org/content/the-budding-of-consciousness-%E2%80%93-cc0-ambient-minimalist-theme-yoiyami-blue-series-%E2%80%93-no4 |
| `stillpoint-wind.mp3` | Cosmic Navigation (loop) | Synth-thetic | https://opengameart.org/content/cosmic-navigation |

The Ogg copies of Beach and Nature (`stillpoint-shore.ogg`, `stillpoint-wild.ogg`) were never loaded by the app and have been removed.
